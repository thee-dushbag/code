# Hello World.

![What a Good Day.](./whatyoudoing.jpg )

In this **package**, I record my **coding progress** on the different technologies and programming languages out there.

## Description.
In this package, there is my personal python package called ***mpack*** can be found on **lib/mpack**. Most of the python examples utilize this package. Add it to your **PYTHONPATH** environment to be able to run the programs correctly.

Also, there exists an **include** directory for my c++/c header files found on **lib/include**, also add it in your compiler search path for correct compilation.

There is my linux and vs-code configuration in the directory **lib/conf**, there are some other projects like the **math_interpreter** and the 2048 game engine under **Game2048** folder also it is a python package ready for installation.

And by the way, there is a very powerful, though very buggy, number reader. It converts numbers to there names, eg read(1) -> 'one'.

This is the pride of my amatuer work and some other simple projects scattered around this repository including a local movie website hoster found in **live/python/movie-app** there is the first version, very poorly designed and a second version which is better in terms of usability.
```python
from mpack.number_reader import get_reader
read = get_reader('english)
print(read(34)) # thirty four
# There is also support for swahili and french.
```
