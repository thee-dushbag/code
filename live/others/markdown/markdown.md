# Code Block

## Code Block with no code info

    <head>
        <title>This is the document title.</title>
    </head>

## Code HTML BLOCK

`import json` is similar to <code>import json</code>  
Escaping the tick marks `` Above is `import json`  ``  
You should use double ticks and use the single ticks  
inside them.

## Fenced Code Blocks

Used to also name the type of code being used
eg Some HTML Code Example...
This will also enable Syntax highlighting
```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Document Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Heading Here</h1>
    <p>Some paragraphs and others...</p>
    <div>Last but not final, the div.</div>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Horizontal Rule.

## Code Block
Another way to do code blocks using `~~~` characters at the start adnd end of the block.
Example using `~~~json <!-- json content here --> ~~~`
~~~json
{
    "name": "Mark John",
    "age": 20,
    "email":"simongash@gmail.com"
}
~~~
